    <h2> About LGS </h2>
    LGS offers one of the broadest range of GCSE subject choices in Pakistan. <br>
     Along with a renowned Science Department, a strong Liberal Arts Department with subjects such as Global Perspectives, World Affairs and English Literature, are the cornerstone of our program. <br> 
     These three years are particularly important as students sit their O Levels at the end of year 11. <br> 
     In Senior School, our aim is to help our students discover their areas of interest and talent so that they may become well-rounded and well-informed individuals who are able to rationalize their thoughts, formulate opinions, make arguments and complement them with vigor and determination.
